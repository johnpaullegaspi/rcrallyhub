# RC Rally Hub by Garahe — Website

The official multi-page website for **RC Rally Hub by Garahe**, a covered pickleball venue inside Garahe by Chef Rods Restaurant in Pala-o, Iligan City, Philippines. Built with [Astro](https://astro.build), TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, content-managed with [Sveltia CMS](https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms), and deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).

This is a fully static site — there is no database and no live booking backend yet. The 5‑step booking form collects a request and shows a **"Pending Confirmation"** reference number; a human confirms real bookings by phone/Messenger until a backend is connected (see [Connecting a Real Booking Backend](#connecting-a-real-booking-backend)).

## Local Development

Requires **Node.js 18.17+** (Node 20/22 recommended).

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The dev server runs at `http://localhost:4321`. The CMS admin is reachable at `http://localhost:4321/admin` but will only fully authenticate against your real GitHub repo once deployed (see [Sveltia CMS Authentication Setup](#sveltia-cms-authentication-setup)) — for pure content-writing on your machine, editing the YAML/Markdown files in `src/content/` directly is equally valid and instant.

Other scripts:

```bash
npm run build             # astro check + full static build to dist/
npm run preview           # serve the built dist/ locally, like production
npm run verify:booking-time   # run the automated midnight-crossing assertions
```

## Content Model & The Single Source of Truth

Every editable piece of content lives under `src/content/` as an Astro **content collection** (schemas defined in `src/content/config.ts`). Nothing is hardcoded into components — all business info, copy, rates, events, gallery items, videos, testimonials, FAQs, and chatbot text are pulled from these files at build time.

**`src/content/settings/settings.yml` is the single source of truth** for:

- Business name, tagline, logo, favicon
- Address & location description
- Operating hours (both the human-readable string and the `HH:mm` values used by the booking system)
- Contact details — mobile, email, Facebook, Messenger — **each with an `...IsDummy: true` flag**. These are currently placeholder values (`0917 555 7288`, `play@rcrallyhub.com`, `facebook.com/RCRallyHub`). Replace them with real details and flip the matching `IsDummy` flag to `false` and the "(DUMMY)" badge next to them on the Contact page and footer disappears automatically.
- Social links, the announcement bar, footer text, and default SEO title/description/share image

Change something here once and it updates everywhere it's used (header, footer, contact page, chatbot answers, structured data, etc.) — you never need to hunt for a second place to edit hours or an address.

## Editing Content With Sveltia CMS

Once deployed, open **`https://your-site.netlify.app/admin`** and log in (see auth setup below). The left sidebar has one section per content type, matching the collections in `public/admin/config.yml`:

- 🏓 **Global Settings** — the `settings.yml` file described above
- 📄 **Pages** — per-page hero heading/subheading/meta for each of the 15 routes
- 🏠 **Home Page Sections** — quick highlights, why-choose-us cards, animated stats, booking-steps copy
- 🙋 **About Page Sections** — values, team, partners
- 💰 **Rates & Packages** — one entry per package/rate card, with an `isPlaceholderPrice` flag
- 🏆 **Tournaments & Events** — listing + full detail page per event, with status/category
- 🖼️ **Gallery** — one entry per photo, with category, alt text, and display order
- 🎬 **Videos** — Facebook video entries; only the pre-generated `facebook.com/plugins/video.php` **Approved Embed URL** is ever rendered (see [Chatbot](#chatbot-rally-assistant) note on safety below)
- 💬 **Testimonials** — customer quotes shown in the homepage carousel
- ❓ **FAQs** — question/answer/category, plus a "use as chatbot answer" toggle
- 🎾 **Booking Add-ons** — optional extras shown in the booking flow
- 🤖 **Rally Assistant Chatbot** — greeting, fallback message, quick replies, contact actions
- 📜 **Policies** — Privacy, Terms, and Cancellation & Rescheduling body text

All fields have labels and hints in the CMS UI — no code editing is required for day-to-day content updates.

## Sveltia CMS Authentication Setup

The CMS backend is configured as `github` in `public/admin/config.yml`. **Do not use Netlify Identity or Git Gateway** — both are deprecated/sunset by Netlify. Instead, use Netlify's built-in **OAuth provider for external Git-based CMS tools**, which is the currently supported method:

1. Push this repository to GitHub.
2. In the Netlify dashboard: **Site settings → General → set the correct repo**, then go to **Site settings → Access control → OAuth**.
3. Under "Authorized OAuth applications for Git-based CMS", add a provider for **GitHub** and follow Netlify's prompts to link a GitHub OAuth App (Netlify will show you the exact callback URL to paste into GitHub's OAuth App settings at `github.com/settings/developers`).
4. In `public/admin/config.yml`, set `backend.repo` to `your-github-username/your-repo-name` and `backend.branch` to the branch you deploy from (default `main`).
5. Visit `https://your-site.netlify.app/admin`, click "Login with GitHub", and authorize. You must be a collaborator on the GitHub repo to be granted write access.

If Netlify ever changes or retires this OAuth flow, check [Sveltia CMS's own backend docs](https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms#configuration) for the current supported alternatives (self-hosted OAuth client, GitLab, etc.) before assuming any specific provider is still available.

## Common Editing Tasks

**Update hours or address** → CMS: *Global Settings*. Directly in code: `src/content/settings/settings.yml`. If hours change, also update `operatingHoursStart` / `operatingHoursEnd` (24-hour `HH:mm`) — these drive the booking time-slot generator.

**Replace the dummy phone/email/Facebook** → CMS: *Global Settings → Contact Details*, update the value and set the matching `Is ... a Dummy/Placeholder?` toggle to off.

**Add/edit a rate package** → CMS: *Rates & Packages → New Rate*. Prices are plain display text (e.g. `"Starting at ₱250 per hour"`) — update `isPlaceholderPrice` to `false` once real pricing is confirmed.

**Add a tournament/event** → CMS: *Tournaments & Events → New Event*. Set `status` (Upcoming / Registration Open / etc.) and `featured` to control homepage visibility.

**Add gallery photos** → CMS: *Gallery → New Gallery Item*. Upload the image (saved to `public/images/uploads`), pick a category, and always fill in the **Alt Text** field for accessibility.

**Add a video** → CMS: *Videos → New Video*. You need the video's **embed URL**, generated at Facebook's [Video Plugin tool](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/embedded-video-player) — paste the resulting `https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?...` URL into "Approved Embed URL". Any other domain is silently ignored by `VideoCarousel.astro` for security (see below).

**Update testimonials** → CMS: *Testimonials*. All 10 launch testimonials are pre-loaded; add, remove, or reorder freely with `displayOrder`.

**Update FAQs / chatbot answers** → CMS: *FAQs*. Any FAQ with "Use as Chatbot Answer" on becomes searchable by the Rally Assistant chatbot automatically — no separate chatbot content to maintain.

**Update chatbot greeting/quick replies/fallback text** → CMS: *Rally Assistant Chatbot*.

## The Midnight-Crossing Booking Schedule

RC Rally Hub is open **Monday to Sunday, 6:00 AM to 3:00 AM** — i.e. every "day" of bookable hours actually spans into the next calendar date. This is handled entirely in `src/lib/booking-time.ts` using real `Date` arithmetic (never bare string/hour comparisons), so:

- Selecting an evening date generates slots through **11:00 PM, 12:00 AM, 1:00 AM, 2:00 AM** — the last bookable start time, ending by 3:00 AM.
- Slots at or after midnight are visually labeled **"next day"** and correctly attributed to the next calendar date internally, without ever changing which business day the booking belongs to.
- A booking that starts before midnight and runs past it (e.g. 10:00 PM + 3 hours) correctly computes an end time of 1:00 AM the following calendar date.

This logic is covered by an automated check:

```bash
npm run verify:booking-time
```

which asserts 17 conditions (slot count, exact labels, date rollover, multi-hour crossing bookings, and that no slot is ever generated past the 3:00 AM close). Run this after any change to `operatingHoursStart`/`operatingHoursEnd` or to `booking-time.ts` itself.

## Deploying to Netlify

1. Push this project to a GitHub (or GitLab/Bitbucket) repository.
2. In Netlify: **Add new site → Import an existing project**, select the repo.
3. Build settings are already defined in `netlify.toml` — Netlify will detect `npm run build` and `dist` automatically; you shouldn't need to change anything.
4. Set `NODE_VERSION` (already pinned to `20` in `netlify.toml`) — override in Netlify's UI only if you need a different version.
5. Deploy. Netlify will build and give you a `*.netlify.app` URL.
6. Update `SITE_URL` in `astro.config.mjs` and `site_url`/`display_url` in `public/admin/config.yml` to your real domain (or the final `*.netlify.app` URL) so sitemap/SEO/CMS links are correct, then redeploy.
7. Set up Sveltia CMS auth (see above) so editors can log in at `/admin`.
8. (Optional) Add a custom domain under **Site settings → Domain management**, and add environment variables under **Site settings → Environment variables** if/when you connect real integrations (see below).

Netlify automatically rebuilds and redeploys whenever new commits land on the deploy branch — including commits made by Sveltia CMS itself when an editor publishes content.

## Netlify Forms

Both the Contact form (`ContactForm.astro`) and the Book a Court form (`BookingForm.astro`) include a real static `<form data-netlify="true">` in the built HTML, which is what Netlify's form-detection bot requires — this is already wired up and needs no extra configuration. Submissions appear under **Site → Forms** in the Netlify dashboard. To get email notifications for new submissions, go to **Site → Forms → Settings and usage → Add a notification**.

## Connecting a Real Booking Backend

The current booking flow is intentionally front-end-only: it collects a request via Netlify Forms and always shows **"Pending Confirmation"** with a generated reference number — it never claims a slot is confirmed, per design. To make it a real-time system:

1. Build a Netlify Function under `netlify/functions/` (a starting `README.md` with integration notes already lives there) that validates and stores incoming bookings — e.g. writing to a database (Airtable, Supabase, a booking SaaS API, or your own backend).
2. Update `submitBooking()` in `src/lib/client/booking-form.ts` to call your function's endpoint instead of (or in addition to) the Netlify Forms submission.
3. Keep availability logic (`isSlotUnavailable`, `isDateFullyBooked` in `src/lib/booking-time.ts`) but replace the current deterministic demo/seeded-hash data with a real fetch to your backend so the slot grid reflects actual bookings.
4. Only flip a booking's displayed status away from "Pending Confirmation" once your backend has actually confirmed it — never fake a "Confirmed" state on the client.
5. **Never put API keys, secrets, or database credentials in any `.astro` or client-side `.ts` file.** They belong only in Netlify environment variables, read inside a Netlify Function (server-side). See `.env.example` for the documented placeholders.

## Chatbot ("Rally Assistant")

`src/components/ChatbotWidget.astro` renders the widget; `src/lib/client/chatbot.ts` contains the current **rule-based** intent-matching engine (keyword detection → FAQ lookup → canned responses), with conversation history kept in `sessionStorage` for the current tab session only.

It is intentionally architected to make a future upgrade straightforward: swap `buildResponse()`'s rule-based branch for a call to a Netlify Function that proxies to OpenAI (or another LLM), passing the same FAQ/business-info context that's already assembled server-side in `ChatbotWidget.astro`. **Never call OpenAI (or any LLM API) directly from the browser** — always route through a Netlify Function so the API key stays server-side (see `.env.example`).

The widget deliberately avoids overlapping the mobile bottom navigation and the sticky booking bar (`StickyBookingBar.astro`) at all tested breakpoints.

**Video embed safety**: `VideoCarousel.astro` only ever renders an `<iframe>` for a URL whose hostname is exactly `www.facebook.com` and whose path starts with `/plugins/video.php` (see `isApprovedEmbed()`). Raw iframe HTML pasted into the CMS is never executed directly — this prevents a compromised or careless CMS entry from injecting arbitrary markup/scripts.

## SEO & Structured Data

`src/components/SEO.astro` sets a unique title/meta description per page (falling back to `defaultSeo` in Settings), Open Graph/Twitter tags, and canonical URLs. `src/components/StructuredData.astro` emits JSON-LD for `LocalBusiness`/`SportsActivityLocation` (site-wide), `Event` (event detail pages), `FAQPage` (FAQs page), and `BreadcrumbList` (inner pages). `@astrojs/sitemap` generates `sitemap-index.xml` at build time, and `public/robots.txt` disallows `/admin/` and points to the sitemap.

## Accessibility

Built to target **WCAG 2.2 AA**: semantic landmarks and heading order, a visible skip-to-content link, keyboard-operable nav/carousels/accordions/booking flow, visible focus states, sufficient color contrast against the dark brand palette, descriptive alt text on all content images (enforced as a required CMS field on Gallery), `aria-live` regions for the chatbot and slot-availability updates, and `prefers-reduced-motion` handling for all GSAP/CSS animations and the scroll-reveal system.

## Environment Variables

See `.env.example` for the full, documented list. **No environment variables are required to build or run the site today** — the current CMS auth flow (GitHub OAuth via Netlify) and Netlify Forms both work without any secrets in this repo. The placeholders in `.env.example` are reserved for future server-side integrations (a real booking backend, SMS/email notifications, an LLM-powered chatbot) and must only ever be read inside Netlify Functions, never in frontend code.

## Troubleshooting

- **`astro build` fails after upgrading a dependency** — this project pins `astro@^5.18.2`, `@astrojs/sitemap@^3.7.3`, and `@astrojs/tailwind@^6.0.2` together because they're peer-dependency verified against each other; if you bump one, check the others' peer ranges before upgrading.
- **A new content entry doesn't show up** — confirm its `published` field (or equivalent) is `true`, and that you're looking at the collection whose `folder`/`file` matches where the CMS actually saved it (see `public/admin/config.yml`).
- **CMS shows a login error** — re-check the OAuth App setup in [Sveltia CMS Authentication Setup](#sveltia-cms-authentication-setup); a mismatched callback URL is the most common cause.
- **Local dev fonts/maps look unstyled or broken in a sandboxed environment with no outbound internet** — `Layout.astro` loads Google Fonts and the Contact page embeds Google Maps from their public CDNs; both require normal internet access and will work in any standard browser/deployment.
